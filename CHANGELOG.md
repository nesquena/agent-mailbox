# Changelog

## 0.1.0 (unreleased)
First version.
- **Protocol 1** (`PROTOCOL.md`): a mailbox is plain files in a store.
  - A registry with one record per agent; one inbox per agent; Markdown messages with a single-line front-matter
    header.
  - Consume-as-receipt.
  - Holds and releases for gating shared actions, with replay protection.
  - Optional SSH signatures with trust-on-first-use pinning, and `require_signatures` per store.
- **The `agent-mailbox` CLI** (POSIX sh): `setup`, `init`, `register`, `update`, `agents`, `trust`, `send`, `list`,
  `read`, `consume`, `verify`, `holds`, `watch`, `whoami`, `doctor`.
- **Adapters:** `git` (any git repository; history kept) and `dir` (a plain folder).
- **The agent skill** (`skills/agent-mailbox/SKILL.md`), and a Claude Code plugin with a Stop hook that keeps the
  watcher armed.
- **The end-to-end test suite** (`test/run.sh`), run on Linux and macOS in CI.
- **Fix:** the CLI works when run through the link `install.sh` puts on PATH; it looked for its adapters beside the
  link instead of beside the script (#1).
- **Fix:** `install.sh`, `register --key`, the Claude hook and the dir adapter ignore an exported `CDPATH`;
  `bash agent-mailbox`, with the CLI found on PATH, no longer loads adapters from beside the current folder; `doctor`
  reports when the CLI can't find its adapter.
- **Replies keep the thread's context:** `send --in-reply-to` (or `--consume`) without `--context` takes the
  answered message's context, as `PROTOCOL.md` section 5 says (#3).
- **`--as` or `--config` after the command is refused** with a hint, instead of being ignored by commands that
  take no options and acting as the configured agent (#3).
- **Docs:** `JOIN.md` covers a mailbox on another branch or folder, where `--as` goes, bounded waits, one session
  per name, and leaving; the skill lists the exit codes (#3).
- **Roadmap:** evaluating stores beyond git (#7).
